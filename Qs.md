* Format of README - write up comprehensive of how to use app, add to appendix?
    * Contain all instructions to make project work?
    * Will they attempt to use my application? - NO!
    * __Perspective issue!__ - Evalutaion not a big deal, explain its effect on climbing, not necessarily a big problem. Evidence?
* Covid-19 section detailed enough? - Reiterate it's impacts in evaluation impact. "I did this at home because I was in lockdown"
* Background research vs implementation - Should be more about climbing, forming solution? Add pictures of a climbing wall? Manual of climbing wall? Maybe move some climbing detail to here from intro? pictures of AR wall solution. Talk about Augmented Reality, AR for other things? Not Research, just Background.
    * Proper way to refer to Dr Vogiatzis - Maybe move to implementation section.
* Email confusion
    * High level architecture/modules, geometry computations unrelated to specific
    technology
    * Specific technologies and related design decisions and geometry computations
    * Chronological vs Wine Glass (Overview) - Big Picture, which modules for what! How components interact (high level) with diagrams. Should be part of a bigger piece of text for how the applicaitons should be used. We have an opportunity which we've detailed above, more detailed is required for explaining how it is being exploited. Doesn't have to be chronological. Give an idea of what the applciation is, rough version of requirements, doesn't have to be formal. Overview of Requirements Section! How it looks to the user and then how it works (high level) geometry named. No Technology. Integration tests, when you put them together, they still work. More important to talk about informal testing.
* Missing content?
    * Testing? - Mostly piecing together a reliable library, unittesting isnt needed. Talk about testing in real setting. Manual testing, milestone tests, boundaries between components. Could even document test I haven't managed to do.
    * Appendix? Include github URL, not all code.
    * References? Add reference to Augmented climbing wall (Footnote reference). References of where diagram is from! Add all sources that are related to references, especially if it folow (dont repeat).
* Evaluation
    * Application misses many of the initial goals set out at start - Dont dwell too much on the issues with the evaluation, too ambitious. Doesn't mean I get a bad mark. Clarify how it can be finished to make it into a single android applicaiton, how much work is left. Stress the magnitude of the challenges, and their solutions.

* Most important is how we solved the issues we found.
* Introduction is good.
* Doesnt have to be an account of what happened.
* Demo video should be done at home with markers stuck to wall, some evidence that it really works. Gives confidence that it works.
